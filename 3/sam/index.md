# Basic Knowledge!

This week, I wanted to just write a bit of functions for basic knowledge reference.  It's good to become comfortable with the concepts within this, so that way we can internalize them, practice them over and over again. I'll probably do this a few more times through out the year and start to use Golang references, or make the code examples more complex.
